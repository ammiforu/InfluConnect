## Overview

This document outlines the guidelines and best practices for creating and managing campaigns on the InfluConnect platform. Both brands and influencers should follow these guidelines to ensure successful collaborations.

## Campaign Creation Guidelines (For Brands)

### Writing a Good Campaign Brief
A well-written campaign brief increases your chances of attracting the right influencers. Include:
1. **Clear Objectives**: What do you want to achieve? (Brand awareness, product launch, sales conversion, etc.)
2. **Target Audience**: Who are you trying to reach? Be specific about demographics.
3. **Content Requirements**: Exactly what type of content you need (number of posts, video length, etc.)
4. **Brand Guidelines**: Any specific messaging, hashtags, or visual requirements.
5. **Timeline**: Realistic deadlines for content creation and posting.
6. **Compensation**: Be transparent about payment terms and amounts.

### Budget Recommendations
- **Nano Influencers (1K-10K followers)**: $50-$250 per post
- **Micro Influencers (10K-50K followers)**: $250-$1,000 per post
- **Mid-tier Influencers (50K-500K followers)**: $1,000-$5,000 per post
- **Macro Influencers (500K-1M followers)**: $5,000-$10,000 per post
- **Mega Influencers (1M+ followers)**: $10,000+ per post

These are general guidelines. Actual rates vary by niche, platform, and engagement rate.
