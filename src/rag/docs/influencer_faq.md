# Influencer FAQ

## Getting Started

### How do I sign up as an influencer?
Visit the signup page and select "Influencer" as your role. Enter your email, password, first name, and last name. After signing up, you will receive an email verification link. Once verified, you can log in and complete your influencer profile.

### What information do I need for my profile?
Your influencer profile should include:
- **Bio**: A short description of who you are and what content you create.
- **Niche/Category**: Your primary content category (e.g., Fashion, Tech, Food, Fitness, Travel, Beauty, Gaming, Lifestyle).
- **Social Media Platforms**: Links to your Instagram, YouTube, TikTok, Twitter, or other platforms.
- **Follower Count**: Your total follower count across platforms.
- **Engagement Rate**: Your average engagement rate (likes, comments, shares relative to followers).
- **Location**: Your city and country.
- **Profile Picture**: A professional photo or avatar.

### How do I update my profile?
Navigate to the Profile page from the dashboard sidebar. Click "Edit Profile" to update any of your information including bio, social media stats, and niche.

## Campaigns & Collaborations

### How do I find brand campaigns?
Go to the "Discover" page from the sidebar. You can browse available campaigns and filter by category, budget range, and platform requirements.

### How do collaboration requests work?
Brands can send you collaboration requests. You will see pending requests on your "Requests" page. Each request includes the campaign details, compensation offered, and deliverable requirements. You can accept or decline requests.

### What happens after I accept a request?
Once you accept a collaboration request, the campaign status changes to "Active." You can then:
1. Communicate with the brand via the messaging system.
2. View your deliverables and their deadlines.
3. Submit deliverables for brand review.
4. Track the overall campaign progress.

### What are deliverables?
Deliverables are the specific content pieces you need to create for a campaign. Examples include:
- Instagram posts or stories
- YouTube videos
- TikTok videos
- Blog posts
- Product reviews

Each deliverable has a description, deadline, and status (Pending, In Progress, Submitted, Approved, Rejected).

### How do I submit a deliverable?
Go to the campaign page, find the deliverable, and click "Submit." You can add a link to the published content or upload the content file.

## Messaging

### How does the messaging system work?
InfluConnect has a built-in real-time messaging system. You can send messages to brands you are collaborating with. Messages appear in real-time without needing to refresh the page.

### Can I message any brand?
You can message brands that you have an active collaboration or pending request with. You cannot message brands you have no connection with.

## Account & Settings

### How do I reset my password?
Click "Forgot password?" on the login page. Enter your email address and you will receive a password reset link.

### Can I change my role from Influencer to Brand?
No, roles are set during signup and cannot be changed. If you need a brand account, you will need to create a new account with a different email.

### Is my data secure?
Yes. InfluConnect uses Row-Level Security (RLS) to ensure you can only access your own data. All communications are encrypted, and sensitive information is stored securely.
